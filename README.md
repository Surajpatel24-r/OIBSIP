# OIBSIP

Well, I was actively looking for internships in my interest in Android Application Development, then I got to know through my friend that Oasis Infobyte is providing internship opportunities to students. I quickly applied to the internship as it was my first internship and I was excited about the selection. I was happy after receiving the congratulatory mail.

There were 5 tasks given in total and to get our certificates we had to perform at least (3tasks) for the certification.
